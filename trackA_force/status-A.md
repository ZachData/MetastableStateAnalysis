# Track A — STATUS

No card yet (`docs/phase_card.md`); one is added with A1b's reading.

## Units

| unit | state | where |
|---|---|---|
| 1. design, scan, `sympy` check, t* table | **done 2026-10-14** (#201); frozen 2026-10-14 (Blocked 45, with the OV attractive share row beside the reading) | `design-A.md`, `lit-A.md`, `tools/math_checks/a1_collapse_time.py`, `tstar_table.py` |
| 2. A1a, the β producer over 18 steps and the T_eff instrument, with its gate | **built 2026-10-14; the gate fails (G3, G4); the real batch has not run** (Blocked 46) | `a1a.py`, `a1a_gate.py`, `p1c_frames/integration_time.unit_steps`; "A1a's gate" below |
| 3. A1a's re-gate (Blocked 46 (b)) and batch | **re-gate ran 2026-10-14: fails on G4 at 3 frames only; the batch has not run** (Blocked 47) | "A1a's re-gate" below |
| 3. A1b, the reading (H-WARP and 1e's question beside) | not started; runs only after A1a's gate passes | `design-A.md` "A1b" |

Budget: 3 units (`design-A.md` "Exit condition and budget"). Unit 2 is spent without a passing
gate; whether finishing A1a takes a fourth unit is part of Blocked 46.
4 units on the record since Blocked 46 (b); unit 3 is open (its batch waits on Blocked 47).

## A1a's gate (2026-10-14)

**Input:** synthetic only, at the v1 design points (n = 241, 285, 445, 464, 466, 481, 511;
d = 1024; β ∈ {0, 3.5, 7}; starts at pairwise cosine 0 and 0.3; 23 planted steps,
h log-uniform in [0.02, 0.5], `SEED` 20261014); G4's frame is step 143000's block-5 LN1.
**Producer:** `python -m trackA_force.a1a_gate --lift {tangent,log} --out <dir>` at #202's
first commit (`12633c1`; `a1a.code_sha` `1cd68a0b4ba1`, gate `258cb1cb6894`, both in each record);
records `data/trackA/a1a_gate_2026-10-14/a1a_gate_{tangent,log}.json` (~5 min per lift on CPU,
G0 on the GPU). A first run on uncommitted code gave identical numbers.

| arm | bar | tangent lift (as designed) | log lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| G0, `sa_sim` full attention vs (6.9), 21 cells | ≤ 3 %, dt converged | **pass** (≤ 1.2 %) | same (no lift) |
| G1, planted effect, 42 cells | h ≤ 5 %, T ≤ 3 % | **pass** (h ≤ 3.4 %, T ≤ 1.1 %) | **pass** (2.3 %, 0.7 %) |
| G2, planted null | \|T_proj\| ≤ 0.1 T | **pass** (≤ 0.0013 T) | **pass** |
| G3, mixed (ξ ⊥ X, \|ξ\| = \|hX\|) | h and √2 h ≤ 5 % | **fails 4 of 42** (≤ 6.4 %) | **pass** (≤ 4.3 %) |
| G4, frame (raw dynamics read in LN1) | T ≤ 10 % | **fails 8 of 42** | **fails 8 of 42** |

**G3's failure is a known second-order bias, not a code defect:** the tangent part of a step
`V` followed by retraction is `V/√(1+|V|²)`; G3's ξ doubles `|V|²`, and the 4 cells are the
ones whose cloud collapses furthest (end cosine 0.73–0.99, so the field and the steps are
largest). All three lifts are functions of the angle θ a token turns: tangent `sin θ`, log `θ`,
gnomonic `tan θ` (`U'/⟨U', U⟩ − U`). The gnomonic lift is exact for one Euler step followed by
renormalisation (0.0 % on G1–G3), which is also how a block acts if its move is tangent (`/challenge-pr`
on #202, finding 4: not circular, as first written here). The log lift measures arc length, the
continuous-time step that the simulated t* counts; its bias at the planted range is about 2/3 of
the tangent lift's (≤ 4.3 % against ≤ 6.4 %), not half. Per-step only: on T, the tangent lift's
worst is 2.3 %.

**G4 by start and β** (`T_proj/T`, range over the 7 prompts; both lifts within 0.002):

| β | from cosine 0 | from cosine 0.3 |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.93–0.96 | 0.994–0.998 |
| 3.5 | 0.875–0.957 (1 fail, n = 511) | 0.992–0.997 |
| 7 | **0.742–0.838 (7 fails)** | 0.993–0.998 |

Always low. The likely mechanism (not tested): LN1's bias adds a common direction, so in the
LN frame a near-orthogonal raw cloud has a field with a large part along it that raw dynamics
never follow. G4's premise (dynamics in the raw frame) is one of two; a V = I head acts on LN1
rows, bias included, which this arm does not plant.

**What the gate does not test** (`/challenge-pr` on #202, findings 2 and 5): G4 uses one LN1
(block 5 at 143000; at step 0 the bias is 0, so the factor there is likely near 1, elsewhere it
could be below 0.742); G2's random tangent directions cannot align with the field in 1,023
dimensions, so G2 cannot fail, while a drift shared by all tokens (the confound that matters,
since at positive mean cosine the field points at the cloud's mean) is not planted.

**What did not run:** the real batch (β over 18 steps, the hooked pass, t*). No real T, t*, β
or cosine has been read, so Blocked 46 is decided before any real output.

## A1a's re-gate (2026-10-14, Blocked 46 (b))

**Input:** as "A1a's gate" below, plus the LN1 weights of every block at the 18 steps (`ln_sha`
`eea24ba8de2b`); the sweep's prompt `latex_monograph`. **Producer:**
`python -m trackA_force.a1a_gate --out <dir> --workers 8` at `8c1c0b6` (`a1a.code_sha`
`dd20504f0cf4`, gate `45aca91d844f`); record `data/trackA/a1a_regate_2026-10-14/a1a_gate.json`,
1h52m (CPU; see "How to re-run"). **Verdict (log lift): G0–G3 pass, G4 fails.**

| arm | bar | log (the verdict) | tangent | gnomonic |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1, 42 cells | h ≤ 5 %, T ≤ 3 % | pass (h ≤ 2.3 %) | pass (3.4 %) | pass (0.0 %) |
| G3, 42 cells | ≤ 5 % | **pass** (≤ 4.3 %) | fails 4 | pass (0.0 %) |
| G4, 42 cells, block 5 at 143000 | \|T_proj/T − 1\| ≤ 0.1 | **pass** (0.988–1.004) | pass | pass |
| G4 sweep, blocks 0–22 × 18 steps, 2,592 cells | same | **fails 7** (0.913–1.344) | fails 7 | fails 7 |
| G4raw (the first G4, beside) | – | 0.742–0.998 | same | same |
| G2s, shared drift (beside, no bar) | – | **0.121–0.870 of T** | 0.121–0.868 | 0.121–0.874 |

**Where G4 fails** (`T_proj/T`, log): only step 143000, blocks 20–22, always *high*, and 6 of 7
from the orthogonal start: block 20 β 0/3.5/7 at g0 = 0: 1.139, 1.107, 1.332; block 21 β 7: 1.183;
block 22 β 0/3.5/7: 1.162, 1.114, 1.344. From g0 = 0.3 every gated cell passes (0.913–1.076).
Without step 143000 the sweep is 0.933–1.055. Block 23 (beside) reaches 1.517 at 143000 and
1.129 at 54000. The worst cells (β 7, g0 = 0) are the ones whose planted cloud barely moves (frame
cosine 0.012 → 0.042), so T is read off the smallest field; mechanism not tested.

**G2s** says a drift shared by all tokens reads as 12–87 % of T in `T_proj`. Beside by design
(no bar), but it is the confound A1b's reading has to answer, not a footnote.

**How to re-run:** the same command. Since this record, `a1a_gate.py` changed only in its pool
(one BLAS thread per spawned worker; 8 jobs 21 s against 124 s; values within 3e-11) and its sweep
lines (both ends, the count outside the bar, the failing cells at the end); `gate_code` is now
different, so `check_gate` needs a re-run before any batch. ~20 min expected, not yet measured
end to end.

## Before any output (2026-10-14)

No model, no data. **Input:** eq. (6.9) only. **Producer:** `python -m trackA_force.tstar_table`;
the table is in `design-A.md` "t* before any output" (one copy). What it fixed: the registered
t* ≈ 4.2 is the orthogonal-start time; from a start at mean cosine 0.3 it is ≈ 1.5 at every β,
and from g0 = 0 it is flat in β only to ≈ 5.6. With the causal mask (6.9) lacks
(`python -m trackA_force.sa_sim`, after `/challenge-pr` on #201), t* rises steeply with β (14.8
at 5.6, n = 467), so A1's comparator is the causal simulation from the measured cloud.
`sympy`: `tools/math_checks/a1_collapse_time.py`, 4 of 4 pass; tests `tests/test_trackA_tstar.py`,
`tests/test_trackA_a1a.py`.

## Parked

- *The 2D spike* (the user's, 2026-10-14): homed as ROADMAP §7 B2a with its exit and budget;
  its slot (before A1b, or B2a after A1 closes) is picked at A1a's close.
